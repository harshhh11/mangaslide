# Manga Slide
A smooth sliding animation created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript Web Animation API 

It works by listening to mouse events (mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup) and updating the position of the images accordingly. It calculates the horizontal movement of the mouse and animates the image track and individual images within the track to create a smooth sliding effect.
